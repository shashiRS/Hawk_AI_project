We chose Whitefield because it is a quiet, exclusive residential area with schools, malls, healthcare facilities, software parks, and places of business – all within a 10-15 minute drive.Emerson Park has been designed to define old-world charm in a modern luxurious environment. Our small community concept promotes easier living, greater harmony and peace of mind while retaining exclusivity thus making it a great place to raise your children. The low population density ensures that residents get a sense of privacy even while sharing the swimming pool and the club house facilities. Cobbled one-way interior driveways that require cars to drive slowly add to the safe and practical allure of our residential offerings. 34 homes have been laid out in two blocks making optimal use of the area. The living spaces are located on a mezzanine level, 8 feet above the road guaranteeing complete privacy from pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Each home includes 2 private covered parking spots on the ground level.Openness is an important aspect of our design and we incorporate skylights and windows to provide ambient light and cross-ventilation. Living rooms come with 12 ft high ceilings and small landscaped spaces that bring nature indoors and provide residents with mini green courts. We are proud to share that Emerson Park is Vaastu compliant without compromising the modern design or practical nature of our homes.","
