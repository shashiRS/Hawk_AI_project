Things like privacy, light, space and ventilation . that's why we call our apartments, PLUS Homes: Perfect ventilation, Lively light, Utmost privacy and Smart space. So, what makes a PLUS home unique?To begin with, we use space to build bigger rooms, not passages. Our entrances do not directly open into bedrooms or living rooms. Large windows give you a view of the cityscape, not your neighbour's apartment. And because natural light does not penetrate more than 18 feet from a source, we make sure there are several sources. ","

But now, Century Infiniti comes to the rescue, giving you all the basic amenities along with a very splendid living experience.One of the things that the builder flaunts about the project is the location. The location being in the Sarjapur in Bangalore. The site is merely 12 kms away from the railway station, 55 kms away from the International Airport and about 4 kms from the Central Bangalore, which makes it a very ideal location for residents. The builder further offers the customers all the basic amenities, like a play area, swimming pool and multiple other basic facilities that one demands from a builder.

The Sipani Group is renowned for its pioneering work in the Indian automotive industry during the 1980s. When Indian consumers had a choice of just 2 cars, both using technology of the 1950s, the Sipani Group was the first in India to take the bold step of bringing in contemporary automotive technology to the Indian consumers. The Sipani Group pioneered an initiative through its very own car,The Sipani Dolphin, long before the arrival of Multinational Companies. It was only after this bold move that other Companies followed by bringing in new technology. This move literally changed the landscape and structure of the automotive Industry. It was a revolutionary step for the transformation of the market; a move, the Sipani Group is dignified and distinguished for. In 2004,the Group forayed into the Realty Sector and went on to construct its first Residential Apartment project in 2009-Sipani Grande.

We chose Whitefield because it is a quiet, exclusive residential area with schools, malls, healthcare facilities, software parks, and places of business – all within a 10-15 minute drive.Emerson Park has been designed to define old-world charm in a modern luxurious environment. Our small community concept promotes easier living, greater harmony and peace of mind while retaining exclusivity thus making it a great place to raise your children. The low population density ensures that residents get a sense of privacy even while sharing the swimming pool and the club house facilities. Cobbled one-way interior driveways that require cars to drive slowly add to the safe and practical allure of our residential offerings. 34 homes have been laid out in two blocks making optimal use of the area. The living spaces are located on a mezzanine level, 8 feet above the road guaranteeing complete privacy from pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Each home includes 2 private covered parking spots on the ground level.Openness is an important aspect of our design and we incorporate skylights and windows to provide ambient light and cross-ventilation. Living rooms come with 12 ft high ceilings and small landscaped spaces that bring nature indoors and provide residents with mini green courts. We are proud to share that Emerson Park is Vaastu compliant without compromising the modern design or practical nature of our homes.","

Location AdvantagesMG Road 19 KmEsteem Mall 10.2 KmColumbia Asia Hospital 10 KmBengaluru International Airport 22 KmMalya Aditi International School: 2 KmRMZ Galleria Mall: 2.8 kmProject USPWhat is Esteem Northwood? Esteem Northwood, is a luxury villa development and the first property of its kind on the yelahanka - Doddaballapur stretch.   The project boasts of a green layout with a number of evergreen trees, landscaped gardens giving the feel of an international development. The project is spread across 3.5 acres of land and consisting of 22 units with a spread of 10 Villaments, 8 Villas and 4 Mansions loaded with high end specifications.Where is Yelahanka located? What is the importance of this location? Where the six-lane highway from Bangalore city to the international airport in Devanahalli branches off to the left into Doddaballapur Road, a hoarding proclaims: “Yelahanka is the new Gurgaon”. Put up by a residential builder, it is a defining marker in the growth curve of Yelahanka, a suburb 15 km north of the city that was envisaged as a satellite town but is now under the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Proximity to the new airport - 20 km away - has given aspirations to the town that has seen a huge property boom in the last five-six years. One of its greatest strengths is its planning in time and is known as one of the few suburbs in India that can boast of infrastructure and connectivity in tandem with development.What other facilities would be provided if I own a Villa/Mansion? One of the advantages of this project besides its high end specification and amenity list is its legal structure. Owners will be buying a plot and a house on it and can modify the house and sell it individually in the future as a plot as well thus giving it an individual house feel in a gated community. You will also be benefited with the in place infrastructure in the layout. Can I customize the villa according to my need? Yes, Esteem Group understands that most people build a house once in their lifetime. We are open to all kinds of internal customizations and changes and even have options of a second floor. While it is under construction, Esteem Group is happy to entertain all kinds of internal changes besides structural changes. Our design team will work with you to customize your villa and make it your home.
