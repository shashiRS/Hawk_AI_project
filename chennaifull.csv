Kotturpuram, a centrally located precinct in Chennai, on the banks of the Adyar River started attracting the attention of home buyers only in the mid 80s when a number of housing projects started coming up in, what is today known as, Kottur Gardens. Today Kotturpuram is a hot spot mainly because of its location, as it is very close to Anna Salai as well as the IT (Information Technology) Corridor and to Adyar and Besant Nagar. There is easy access to the business districts as well as to the social ones. This is one of the main reasons why people look for apartments to rent in Kotturpuram.Project USP:This is one of the main reasons why people look for apartments to rent in Kotturpuram.

All these flats for sale in Pallikaranai Chennai from Puravankara come with an option of a “Manhattan interior package”. The Manhattan interior package offers the proud owners of these condos, an option to get their apartments furnished prior to taking possession.

These flats in Pallikaranai are located only 6 kms away from both Velachery MRTS and Old Madras Road and a mere 7 kms away from Velachery. Even the airport seems like it is next door by being 10 kms away. Tech giants like HCL, Wipro, Infosys, TCS, Siemens, Accenture, Satyam etc. are all in the vicinity of these flats in Chennai for sale. Numerous premier educational institutions, world-class multi-speciality hospitals, hotels, resorts, shopping centres and eateries are all in the neighbourhood.

That too at an irresistible price.Vengaivasal is going to be the gateway that connects you to so many future developments. The Monorail to defuse traffic congestion has been planned from Vandalur to Velachery via Medavakkam. Meanwhile, Medavakkam will also feature in the Corridor 5 of Chennai Metro Rail. Whats even more interesting is Tambaram Station is going to be upgraded soon to be the third terminal after Chennai Central and Egmore. Add to this the excitement of the Urapakkam Bus Terminus. The expansion of the Velachery-Tambaram Road to a six-lane highway only makes the location even more buzz-worthy. Not to mention the eco-tourism initiatives being planned in the Nanmangalam Reserve Forest.Connectivity:Vengaivasal Bus Terminus - 1 kmMedavakkam Junction - 3.5 kmTambaram Railway Station - 7 kmSholinganallur Junction - 8 kmVelachery MRTS Station - 12 kmEmployment Hubs Nearby:MEPZ Tambaram - 8 kmElcot SEZ - 8 kmShriram SEZ  - 11 kmTidel Park, Ascendas - 1.6 kmSiruseri IT Park - 1.6 km Schools Nearby:Alpha Matriculation - 2 kmMAV Vidyashram CBSE - 2 kmZion Matriculation - 3 kmAlwin Memorial - 3 kmSt. Johns Public - 3.5 kmVelammal New Gen - 3.5 kmShree Gugans CBSE - 4.5 kmRavindra Bharathi Global - 4.9 kmNPS International - 6.6 kmBVM Global - 7 kmPSBB Millenium - 9.4 kmHeadstart International IGCSE - 9.5 km Colleges Nearby:New Prince Shri Bhavani Engineering College - 0.2 kmQaid E Millath College - 2 kmBharath University - 5 kmAsan Memorial College - 5 kmMadras Christian College - 6 kmSri Balaji Dental College - 7 kmHospitals Nearby:Global Hospitals - 7 kmSri Balaji Dental Hospital - 7 kmKamakshi Hospital - 8 kmHindu Mission Hospital - 8 kmApollo Hospital - 9 kmConveniences Nearby:More Supermarket - 1.6 kmApollo Pharmacy - 1.6 kmSekar Stores - 2 kmHDFC Bank - 2 kmReliance Fresh - 2.2 kmNilgiris - 4 km Eateries Nearby:Coffee Day - 3 kmIbaco - 4 kmAdyar Bakery - 2.5 kmDominos - 3 kmCascade  - 3.2 kmSangeetha - 3.4 km
