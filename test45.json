Its salubrious climate and work culture make it a natural choice for most of the private and public sector industries which sectors include software, telephone, aeronautics, electrical equipment, heavy electrical and now especially, the IT in peak.Because of its colourful and lively antecedents and its developmental history, Bangalore is a city of great diversity offering residents and visitors a range of diversion clubs and resorts, pubs and restaurants, bowling alleys, spiritual places and with no doubt, huge number of shopping centers and multiplexes.
