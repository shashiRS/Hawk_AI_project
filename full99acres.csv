About Locality,
Yelahanka, a famous residential suburb of North Bangalore comes under Bruhat Bangalore Mahangara Palike (BBMP), the civic body of Bangalore. The locality is enjoying an elevated status owing to realty developments in and around it in the last few years. This growth in the property market is due to numerous factors including shift of new international airport to nearby Devanahalli, improved infrastructure, connectivity via robust road structures, and proximity to IT/ITEs. Apart from these positive notions, residential projects property values have decreased and as a result, demand for the residential apartments have increased.,
