After I made Lanco Hills my home, I found a new passion in the game of Racquetball.I developed a passion for the game and started hitting the courts at 6 am, everyday! My family and friends were surprised to see me wake up so early and adopt a strict discipline of playing every day and improve my game. Indeed it was a new lifestyle for me, but one that added exhilaration to an otherwise mundane routine. The turning point came when in March 2014 when our Club Zeus at Lanco Hills hosted the first international Racquetball tourney in India.
